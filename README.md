# Overwiew

This is my first Milestone Project for Code Insitute.
The project is a website for a restaurant and it uses basic Html5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
I got inspired by the restaurant I've been working for a year now, so the menus, the pictures and the logos are taken from a real place, with permission from the owners to use their copyrighted material. 
It's important for me to add that the restaurant has a website already, and it can be seen here: [barrobusta.se](https://www.barrobusta.se/). I didn't take any inspiration from it, but the existing website gave me a fun challenge to create a new representation of the place that can reflect fairly its mood and brand.

# Objective
The main focus of this project is to produce a responsive, clean and intuitive product which also contains
 all the useful informations a user would expect to find on a restaurant website.

 ## Goal of the Business

# Credits
I started working on a first raw version of this project on October and it can be seen here: [BarRobusta](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/BarRobusta).
## External Credits
* I found myself relying a lot on [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) whenever I had a doubt on specific issues. 
* I checked suggestions on [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for what concernes:
    * [The Booking form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/forms/)
* Calendar date picker is from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local)

## Bugs
* The table element wasn't responsive so I've found a nice compromise on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40512604/bootstrap-table-is-not-responsive)
