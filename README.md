# Overwiew
This is my first Milestone Project for Code Insitute. The project is a website for a restaurant
 and it uses basic Html5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap and a bit of JavaScript where needed.

# Objective
The main focus of this project is to produce a responsive, clean and intuitive product which also contains
 all the useful informations a user would expect to find on a restaurant website.

 ## Goal of the Business

 ## Goal of the User
 

 # Features

 The website is build with page areas, and it contains:
 * A homepage with external links to the social medias;
 * A menu section with a "special annoucements" board;
 * A photo gallery;
 * An events section;
 * A contacts page with a booking form.

# Credits
I started working on a first raw version of this project on October and it can be seen here: [BarRobusta](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/BarRobusta).
## External Credits
I never took entire codes from any other user or website but I found myself relying a lot on [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) whenever I had a doubt on specific issues. I also checked suggestions on [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for what concernes the Events section (where I used a table element to build a calendar of events) and the Contacts section to build up properly a form to book a table.
