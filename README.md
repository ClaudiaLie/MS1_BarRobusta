# Overwiew

This is my first Milestone Project for Code Insitute.
The project is a website for a restaurant and it uses basic Html5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
I got inspired by the restaurant I've been working for a year now, so the menus, the pictures and the logos are taken from a real place, with permission from the owners to use their copyrighted material. 
It's important for me to add that the restaurant has a website already, and it can be seen here: [barrobusta.se](https://www.barrobusta.se/). I didn't take any inspiration from it, but the existing website gave me a fun challenge to create a new representation of the place that can reflect fairly its mood and brand.

# Objective
The main focus of this project is to produce a responsive, clean and intuitive product which also contains
 all the useful informations a user would expect to find on a restaurant website.

# Credits
I started working on a first raw version of this project on October and it can be seen here: [BarRobusta](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/BarRobusta).
## External Credits
* I found myself relying a lot on [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) whenever I had a doubt on specific issues. 
* I also checked suggestions on [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for what concernes the Events section (where I used a table element to build a calendar of events) and the Contacts section to build up properly a form to book a table.
