# Overwiew

This is my first Milestone Project for Code Insitute.
The project is a website for a restaurant and it uses basic Html5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
I got inspired by the restaurant I've been working for a year now, so the menus, the pictures and the logos are taken from a real place, with permission from the owners to use their copyrighted material. 
It's important for me to add that the restaurant has a website already, and it can be seen here: [barrobusta.se](https://www.barrobusta.se/). I didn't take any inspiration from it, but the existing website gave me a fun challenge to create a new representation of the place that can reflect fairly its mood and brand.

# Objective
The main focus of this project is to produce a responsive, clean and intuitive product which also contains
 all the useful informations a user would expect to find on a restaurant website.

 ## Goal of the Business

 ## Goal of the User
 

 # Features

 The website is build with page areas, and it contains:
 * A homepage with external links to the social medias;
 * A menu section with a "special annoucements" board;
 * A photo gallery;
 * An events section;
 * A contacts page with a booking form.

# Credits
I started working on a first raw version of this project on October and it can be seen here: [BarRobusta](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/BarRobusta).
## External Credits
* I found myself relying a lot on [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) whenever I had a doubt on specific issues, such as:
    * [Direct mail to an address](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp)
* I checked suggestions on [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for what concernes:
    * [The Booking form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/forms/)
    * [The Carousel Gallery](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/)
* Calendar date picker is from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local)


# Testing Details
* [README.md file](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/MS1_BarRobusta/blob/main/README.md)
* [View Website on GitHub](https://github.com/ClaudiaLie/MS1_BarRobusta)

## Testing

To check the vadility of the website's code, I have used:
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

To audit the quality of the webpage I used:
 * [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools)

## Website navigation

To make sure that the website will be efficent 

## Bugs
* The table element wasn't responsive so I've found a nice compromise on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40512604/bootstrap-table-is-not-responsive) implementing a side scrollbar for smaller screens.
* I wanted to add a map using a Google Maps API, but I found out that unfortunately it can't be an option for this project since Google requests a payment to generate a code. I decided to simply include an image with a map tag that shows the location on a screenshotted map.
* After the first validation of the website, 7 errors have been found: ![Validator](https://browser-c1571e35-5596-40ee-bac9-d98cce9f9b65.ws-eu03.gitpod.io/workspace/MS1_BarRobusta/assets/img/Validator_CSS.jpg).
    * I fixed the wrong value on the background-size, by changing it to "cover".
    * 
* The first Lighthouse test showed that I could have improved the performance using the following suggestions:
    * Using a better formats for the header image;
    * Deleting the unecessary JavaScript snippets;
    *
